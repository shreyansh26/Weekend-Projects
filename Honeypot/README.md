Honeypot
========

A simple Honeypot made using PHP and HTML. It captures the ip of the computer trying to open a site restricted for crawling, i.e. it is present in the robots.txt file.  

## Requirements
* PHP5 - `sudo apt-get install php`
* PHP for Apache - `sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php`  

Move the files into the `/var/www/html` folder and head to `localhost`.  

**Imp Note** - the logs.txt should have read and write permissions for all users.
