Puppeteer Tutorial
==================

Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control headless Chrome over the DevTools Protocol. It can also be configured to use full (non-headless) Chrome.  

This is a basic tutorial I followed for learning Puppeteer. The tutorial is by [Emad Ehsan](https://github.com/emadehsan/thal).
