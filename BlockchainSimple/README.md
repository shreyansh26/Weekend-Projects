This is a simple illustration of how blockchain works.

## What is a blockchain?

A list of blocks (records) that are linked together using hashes, maintained as a distributed database.

**Distributed**: Copies of a blockchain stored on multiple computers (nodes)

**Decentralised**: If one node updates all other nodes, the blockchain is *centralised*. If any node can update other nodes, it's *decentralised*. To do this securely, a way to reach consensus is needed, via *Proof-of-Work* or *Proof-of-Stake*.

**Proof-of-Work/Stake**: Algorithm by which nodes in a network achieve distributed consensus.

## To run

Go to the root of the project and run `ruby blockchain_generator.rb`.
